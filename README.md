- Calculator that supports all the basic operations (addition subtraction multiplication and division) and decimal point operations and negative number operations, can also clear a character and resets the calculator.
- Communication between two AtMega32 MCUs via UART using a Virtual Port (COMPIM in Proteus).
- Challenges: 
1) multiple operands and operations. 
2) prioritizing the multiplication and division. 
3) negative numbers operations and differentiating between the minus sign and the negative sign (also multiple successive negative signs cancel each other or not if odd number of signs). 
4) decimal point operations. 
5) checking for syntax errors.
6) Clearing a digit was the most challenging task.
